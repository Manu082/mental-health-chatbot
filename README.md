## 📌 Project Overview

The **Mental Health Support Chatbot** is an interactive web-based application built using **Python and Streamlit**, designed to provide emotional support and general health guidance using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as **Tokenization** and **Lemmatization**.

### 🔹 What the Chatbot Does

The chatbot understands user input, detects emotional state and common health problems, and provides:

- **Emotion-aware responses**
- **Practical care suggestions**
- **Safe tablet awareness** *(with medical disclaimer)*

This project is developed for **academic, internship, and learning purposes** and demonstrates the **real-world application of NLP concepts**.

## 🧠 Core NLP Concepts Used

- **Tokenization** – Splitting user input into meaningful words  
- **Lemmatization** – Converting words to their base or root form  
- **Rule-Based Text Understanding** – Detecting emotions and problems without datasets

---

## ✨ Why This Project Is Useful

- Demonstrates **practical NLP implementation**
- Easy to understand and explain in **viva**
- Safe and ethical design for health-related applications
- Deployed globally using **Streamlit Cloud**

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**  
  User-friendly Streamlit-based interface that allows real-time conversation with the chatbot.

- **Emotion Detection**  
  Identifies emotional states such as anxiety, sadness, stress, and neutral mood from user input.

- **Health Problem Identification**  
  Detects common physical and mental health problems like headache, fever, vomiting, blood pressure, weakness, and insomnia.

- **Suggested Care & Solutions**  
  Provides non-medical, practical care tips and lifestyle suggestions based on detected problems.

- **Tablet Awareness Section**  
  Displays commonly known tablet names for awareness only, with a clear medical disclaimer.

- **Rule-Based NLP System**  
  Uses tokenization and lemmatization instead of datasets or model training, making it lightweight and explainable.

- **Global Deployment**  
  Deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud and accessible worldwide through a public URL.

## ⚙️ How the System Works (Step-by-Step)

The chatbot processes user input through multiple NLP-driven stages to provide meaningful and safe responses.

### 🔹 Step 1: User Input
- The user enters text describing their feelings or health problems using the Streamlit interface.

### 🔹 Step 2: Text Preprocessing
- The input text is converted to lowercase.
- **Tokenization** splits the sentence into individual words.
- **Lemmatization** converts words into their base or root form.

### 🔹 Step 3: Emotion Detection
- A rule-based NLP engine analyzes the processed text.
- Emotional states such as **anxiety, sadness, stress, or neutral mood** are identified.

### 🔹 Step 4: Problem Detection
- The system checks for keywords related to common physical and mental health problems.
- Problems such as **headache, fever, vomiting, blood pressure, weakness, and insomnia** are detected.

### 🔹 Step 5: Suggested Care & Solutions
- Non-medical and practical care suggestions are displayed.
- These include lifestyle tips, rest advice, and basic self-care actions.

### 🔹 Step 6: Tablet Awareness Section
- Commonly known tablet names are shown **only for awareness**.
- A clear **medical disclaimer** is provided to avoid misuse.

### 🔹 Step 7: Output Display
- All results are presented in a clean, interactive Streamlit UI.
- The user can continue the conversation in real time.

## 🔮 Future Scope

The current system is rule-based and lightweight. In the future, the project can be enhanced in the following ways:

- **Deep Learning-Based Emotion Detection**  
  Replace rule-based logic with deep learning models such as LSTM, GRU, or Transformer-based models for improved accuracy.

- **Multilingual Support**  
  Enable the chatbot to understand and respond in multiple languages for wider accessibility.

- **Voice Input and Speech Analysis**  
  Integrate speech-to-text and emotion recognition from voice for a more interactive experience.

- **User Personalization**  
  Store user interaction history to provide personalized responses and recommendations.

- **Severity Detection and Alerts**  
  Detect critical conditions and provide emergency guidance or helpline suggestions.

- **Healthcare Professional Integration**  
  Connect the chatbot with certified doctors or counselors for real-time assistance.

- **Mobile Application Deployment**  
  Extend the system to Android and iOS platforms for better reach.
