📌 Project Overview

The Mental Health Support Chatbot is an interactive web-based application built using Python and Streamlit, designed to provide emotional support and general health guidance using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Tokenization and Lemmatization.

The chatbot understands user input, detects emotional state and common health problems, and provides:

Emotion-aware responses

Practical care suggestions

Safe tablet awareness (with medical disclaimer)

This project is developed for academic, internship, and learning purposes and demonstrates the real-world application of NLP concepts.
