## 📌 Project Overview

The **Mental Health Support Chatbot** is an interactive web-based application built using **Python and Streamlit**, designed to provide emotional support and general health guidance using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as **Tokenization** and **Lemmatization**.

### 🔹 What the Chatbot Does

The chatbot understands user input, detects emotional state and common health problems, and provides:

- **Emotion-aware responses**
- **Practical care suggestions**
- **Safe tablet awareness** *(with medical disclaimer)*

This project is developed for **academic, internship, and learning purposes** and demonstrates the **real-world application of NLP concepts**.

## 🧠 Core NLP Concepts Used

- **Tokenization** – Splitting user input into meaningful words  
- **Lemmatization** – Converting words to their base or root form  
- **Rule-Based Text Understanding** – Detecting emotions and problems without datasets

---

## ✨ Why This Project Is Useful

- Demonstrates **practical NLP implementation**
- Easy to understand and explain in **viva**
- Safe and ethical design for health-related applications
- Deployed globally using **Streamlit Cloud**

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**  
  User-friendly Streamlit-based interface that allows real-time conversation with the chatbot.

- **Emotion Detection**  
  Identifies emotional states such as anxiety, sadness, stress, and neutral mood from user input.

- **Health Problem Identification**  
  Detects common physical and mental health problems like headache, fever, vomiting, blood pressure, weakness, and insomnia.

- **Suggested Care & Solutions**  
  Provides non-medical, practical care tips and lifestyle suggestions based on detected problems.

- **Tablet Awareness Section**  
  Displays commonly known tablet names for awareness only, with a clear medical disclaimer.

- **Rule-Based NLP System**  
  Uses tokenization and lemmatization instead of datasets or model training, making it lightweight and explainable.

- **Global Deployment**  
  Deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud and accessible worldwide through a public URL.
